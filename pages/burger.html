    <h2>Fun fact about Burger</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The name "hamburger" comes from Hamburg, Germany, not from ham. 
        The name originated from a German dish called "Hamburg steak," which 
        was minced beef seasoned and formed into a patty.
      </li>
      <li>During World War I, U.S. government officials tried to rename hamburgers
         "liberty sandwiches" to distance them from their German roots, but the name did not stick.
        </li>
        <li>The cheeseburger was likely invented in the 1920s. Different people 
            claimed to be the first to melt cheese on a hamburger patty, including 
            Lionel Sternberger, who worked at his father's sandwich shop in California.

    <h3>History of Burger</h3>
    <p>The hamburger sandwich was created in the United States in the late 19th century 
    by various vendors, though the exact inventor is unknown, with claims from Charles Nagreen
     and the Menches brothers among others. Its history traces back to German "Hamburg steaks" 
     which were ground beef patties served on a plate. The modern hamburger, a ground beef patty
     placed between two slices of bread or a bun, likely emerged as a portable street food at late 
     19th-century fairs and events. The standardization and popularization of the hamburger were 
     significantly advanced by the White Castle fast-food chain in 1921, which marketed the hygienic 
     and affordable burger to the masses.
