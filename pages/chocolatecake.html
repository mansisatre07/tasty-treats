        bitter breads, as sugar wasn't widely available to use with chocolate.

    <h3>History of Chocolate cake</h3>
    <p>The history of chocolate cake began in the mid-18th century when cocoa powder
     was first added to cake recipes, with the first American recipe appearing in 1847.
     Early cakes were light and fluffy, and chocolate was often served as a drink alongside
     a white or yellow cake. Key developments that made rich chocolate cake possible include
     the invention of a mechanical process for making cocoa powder in 1828 and the conching process 
     for making smoother chocolate in 1879. Over time, as chocolate became more available, recipes 
     evolved to create the richer, more decadent cakes we know today, with boxed cake mixes and pre-made 
     cakes emerging in the 1920s.
